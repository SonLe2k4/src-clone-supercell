                                    this at Supercell is by staying small as it
                                    minimizes the amount of bureaucracy and
                                    processes while maximizing room for
                                    innovation. Our teams are nimble,
                                    experimenting with new features and failing
                                    smarter to maximize learning. We are
                                    constantly looking for proactive doers who
